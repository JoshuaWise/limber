add vendor support

confirm micro framework

make sure the p and hx base styles are how I want them (em? inherit? etc.)

bring in JavaScript from Ryan's site

decide what I want to do with body {min-height: 100%} (vh?)

add grid module

add ie10 polyfills
(dataset, flexbox, Uint8ClampedArray, pointer-events: non, classList.prototype.toggle)

make sure outdated browser test accounts for everything used in framework
(use modernizr?)
(make sure browser can handle 'use strict')

confirm full framework
