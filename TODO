make example via build system with grunt and stylus JavaScript API,

make sure the p and hx base styles are how I want them (em? inherit? etc.)
also what I want to do with "font-scale-" in site-globals.styl and validate-globals.styl

bring in JavaScript from Ryan's site

add grid module

add ie10 polyfills
(dataset, flexbox, Uint8ClampedArray, pointer-events: non, classList.prototype.toggle)

vendor support should be handled by autoprefixer?

make sure outdated browser test accounts for everything used in framework
(use modernizr?)
(make sure browser can handle 'use strict')

confirm full framework
