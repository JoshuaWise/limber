don't like how there are 2 types of utilities

anything defined in the site-stylesheet() mixin does not have global scope

make sure the p and hx base styles are how I want them (em? inherit? etc.)

bring in JavaScript from Ryan's site, and add buggyfix for vh
(or apply min-height to body style manually in JavaScript)
